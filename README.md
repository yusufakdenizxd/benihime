# Benihime

**An opinionated, code editor for developers**

Benihime is a keyboard-driven, modal code editor inspired by Emacs, Neovim, and Helix. It’s built for developers who want maximum efficiency and a minimal, modal workflow. Its philosophy is simple: **keyboard-first, no mouse, no compromises—just power**.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Benihime is in **very early development**. Features are minimal, APIs are unstable, and breaking changes will happen often. This editor is designed **for power users only**.
